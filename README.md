# libresprite-extensions
Scripts that update an image. Download them using the Code / Download Zip.. button, put them in the LibreSprite scripts directory (Scripts/Open Folder in LibreSprite), and the select Scripts/Rescan scripts. 

**Warnings**

- The changes can not be undone, if you want to get back from a change you need to close and reopen your working file, so you probably should to save your file before trying to use the scripts. 

**TODO** 

- Save an image automatically before making any update to the sprite, or find a way to undo a change
- And/or Make some sort of preview
